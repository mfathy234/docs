able Component Task
Your task is to create a full Table component in Figma with the following requirements:
1.  Table Structure
Create a table component that supports:
*   Header row with clear labels (sortable columns).
    
*   Body rows with consistent spacing and alignment.
    
*   Pagination section (Previous / Next buttons).
    
1.  Status Indicators (Interactive Elements)
Add different status indicators inside the rows, such as:
*   Profile status → Online / Offline / Away (small colored dot next to avatar).
    
*   Checkbox → Checked / Unchecked / Indeterminate.
    
*   Toggle (Switch) → On / Off.
    
*   Tag/Badge → Different labels (Active, Inactive, Pending).
    
1.  Expandable Row
*   Rows should have an expand/collapse option (arrow or plus icon).
    
*   When expanded, show extra details (e.g., product details, order info, employee info → can be fake data).
    
*   Expanded area should be aligned, with clear spacing and contrast.
    
1.  Variants & Auto Layout
*   Build the table with Variants (Normal row, Expanded row).
    
*   Ensure Auto Layout is applied properly so resizing works smoothly.

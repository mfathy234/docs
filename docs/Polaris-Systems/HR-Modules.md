# 🧑‍💼 HR Modules

Welcome to the **HR Modules** section of Polaris Systems.  
This area will serve as the single source of truth for all HR-related functionality — from requirements to design, HLSD documentation, and sign-off records.  

Our goal is to ensure **clarity, traceability, and alignment** between Microtec and Polaris teams across every HR domain.

## 📑 Inner Pages

Each module will contain structured inner pages to support collaboration and governance:  

- **High-Level Solution Design (HLSD)**  
  Captures architecture and functional workflows for the module before development begins.  

- **User Stories & Requirements**  
  Detailed breakdown of features, acceptance criteria, and business rules.  

- **Design Assets**  
  Wireframes and Figma screens linked directly to the module.  

- **Sign-Off Records**  
  - **Definition of Ready (DOR)** → Approval before development starts.  
  - **Definition of Done (DOD)** → Approval at completion after testing and demo.

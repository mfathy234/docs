# Task Handover Process After Development and Testing
---------------------------------------------------

1.  Once the **Tester** receives the tasks, they upload them to the **Dev Server** for technical testing or any necessary fixes (e.g., unit testing or bug fixes).
    
2.  After the Developer completes their work, the **Tester** performs thorough testing on the updated version to ensure quality.
    
3.  Once testing passes successfully, the Tester hands over the tasks to the **Business Team** for review and to verify that requirements are met.
    
4.  After the Business Team reviews and approves, they deploy the tasks to the **Stage environment** (a pre-production testing environment) and perform final **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.
    
5.  Finally, after confirming quality on the Stage, the tasks are presented to the **Product Team** for final approval.

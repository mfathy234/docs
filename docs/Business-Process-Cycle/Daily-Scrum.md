The **Daily Scrum** is a short, focused meeting held **every day** to align the team and track progress toward the Sprint Goal.

### What happens during the Daily Scrum?

*   Each team member briefly shares:
    *   What was completed since the last Daily Scrum
        
    *   What will be worked on today
        
    *   Any blockers or impediments
        
*   The team checks progress toward the **Sprint Goal**.
    
*   Blockers are highlighted so they can be addressed as quickly as possible.
    
*   The focus is on **alignment and planning for the next 24 hours**, not detailed problem-solving.
    

### Key Rules

*   The meeting is **time-boxed to 15 minutes**.
    
*   It is attended by the **Development Team** 

**(Scrum Master and Product Owner may attend if needed).**
    
*   Updates should be reflected on the **board** after or during the meeting.

*   Helps identify issues early before they become bigger problems.
    
*   Encourages accountability and daily commitment.

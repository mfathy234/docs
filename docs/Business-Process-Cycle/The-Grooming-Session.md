### What happens in a Grooming Session (Backlog Refinement)?

# *   The **Grooming / Backlog Refinement session must be conducted on Sunday**, **one week before Sprint Planning**.
## 
This is a **regular session** where the team prepares the **Sprint Backlog**. During this session, the following activities take place:
*   **Review User Stories and tasks in the backlog**
    *   The team reviews all stories and ensures they are clear and well understood.
        
    *   Each User Story **must have clear Acceptance Criteria**, and **UX designs should be available**, even if they are initial or high-level designs.
        
*   **Update story details**
    *   Add or refine descriptions, Acceptance Criteria, and any missing details.
        
*   **Review and adjust priorities**
    *   Update or correct priorities if needed based on business needs.
        
*   **Estimate User Stories**
    *   The team estimates the effort or size of each User Story.
        
*   **Split large or complex stories**
    *   Large or complex User Stories are broken down into smaller, manageable stories.
        
*   **Prepare stories for Sprint Planning**
    *   Ensure that the stories are “ready” to be planned and committed in the upcoming sprint.
        
*   **Allow time for edits during the week**
    *   There is flexibility during the rest of the week to apply any required updates or refinements.
        
*   **Testing preparation**
    *   Once the Sprint Backlog is finalized, User Stories are assigned to testers in each team so they can prepare test cases and get confirmation from the Business team.
        
*   **Add estimated time**
    *   An estimated time is added to each User Story.

**1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools**  
Success is driven primarily by people and their relationships rather than by rigid frameworks or technological tools.

**2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation**  
Delivering functional and valuable solutions that address real problems takes precedence over producing extensive documentation.

**3. Responding to Change over Following a Plan**  
Adapting to change and leveraging it as an opportunity leads to better outcomes than strictly adhering to a predetermined plan.

**4. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation**  
Fostering strong partnerships with customers results in superior outcomes compared to focusing solely on contractual terms.

📌 Task – Persona Creation
Instructions:
Using the insights you collected from your mock interviews, your next task is to create personas that represent different HR users of ERP systems.
Steps:
1.  Analyze Interview Data
*   Review the answers you gathered in the mock interviews.
    
*   Identify common themes across Goals, Frustrations, and Key Needs.
    
1.  Create Personas
*   Build 3 different personas, each representing a unique target audience character (for example: HR Manager, Payroll Specialist, HR Assistant).
    
*   For each persona, include:
    
    *   Goals → what they want to achieve with the system.
    *   Frustrations → problems or difficulties they face.
    *   Key Needs → features/functions that are essential for them.
*   Add a short description for each persona.
    
*   (Optional) Add a stock photo or illustration to visualize the persona.
    
1.  Combine into Persona Set
*   Present all 3 personas together as a persona set.
    
*   Show how they represent different user types but connect to the same system.
    
✅ Deliverable:
*   A document (Figjam/Notion/Word) that includes:
1.  Three complete personas.
    
2.  A combined persona set overview.
    
📌 Purpose:  
So that any new team member in the future can use these personas as a reference to understand different target user types when designing systems.
📅 Deadline: To be confirmed during training.

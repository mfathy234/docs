📌 Task – Design System Components Research & Comparison
Instructions:
This task will help you build a solid understanding of UI components inside design systems, especially advanced ones like Kanban boards, Wizards, and Trees.
1.  Learn the Terminology
*   Research and define the main UI components used in design systems, such as:
    
    *   Button, Input, Dropdown, Modal, Table, Card, Wizard, Kanban Board, Tree, Tabs, Pagination, etc.
*   For each component, write:
    
    *   A simple definition (one line).
    *   When it’s usually used.
1.  Explore Different Design Systems
*   Study the following design systems and check what components they provide:
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview)
[MUI Design System](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/)
[Carbon Design System (IBM) → includes tables, wizards, and complex layouts.](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview/components/)
[Lightning Design System (Salesforce) → includes tree & kanban.](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/2e1ef8501/p/755aff-components)
Pay special attention to advanced components like Kanban boards, Wizards, and Trees.
1.  Show Understanding (Task)
Create a comparison table with 3 columns:
*   Component name
    
*   Design System it exists in (Ant, MUI, Carbon, Salesforce)
    
*   Notes → short observation about how it’s presented or used differently.
    
Example:
Component Design System Notes  
Wizard Carbon, Salesforce Multi-step forms, clear progress indicator  
Kanban Salesforce Drag-and-drop tasks, cards grouped by status
✅ Deliverable:
A single document (Word, Notion, or Figma board) that includes:
*   A short glossary of component definitions.
    
*   A comparison table showing how different design systems cover components.
    
📌 Purpose:
So that any new team member in the future can quickly learn what common and advanced UI components are, and how different design systems handle them.
📅 Deadline: To be confirmed during training.

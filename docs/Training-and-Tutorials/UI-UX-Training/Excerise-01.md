Task – ERP Systems Research & Comparison
Instructions:
During the training, we will assign you a specific system or module to focus on. For now, your task is to practice a structured research approach that you will apply to any ERP system/module we choose later.
Steps:
1.  Explore the System
*   Identify the main sections/features available (e.g., employees, payroll, attendance, leaves, etc., depending on the assigned module).
    
*   Pay attention to the UI design:
    
    *   Colors
    *   Layouts
    *   Buttons
    *   Icons
    *   Forms and tables
*   Check if the system seems to follow a design system (repeated styles, consistent components, patterns of interaction).
    
1.  Take Notes
*   Write down your findings in a simple bullet-point list.
    
*   Keep it clear and easy to understand so that it can be reused by anyone later.
    
1.  Comparison (UI, UX, Features)
*   Compare between the systems you reviewed:
    *   UI → visual style, consistency, clarity.
    *   UX → ease of navigation, user flows, error handling.
    *   Features → what each system offers and how they differ.
✅ Deliverable:
A document (Word/Notion/Figjam) with :
1.  Notes for each system/module.
    
2.  A comparison table or list (UI / UX / Features).
    
📌 Purpose:
So that any new team member in the future can use it as a guide to perform competitor analysis.
📅 Deadline: To be set during training, depending on the assigned system/module.

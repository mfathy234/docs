Design System Components Task – Figma Exercise
Your task is to go through the following steps as one complete exercise:
1.  Components Creation
*   Based on references like Preview [Minimal Web Design System](https://www.figma.com/design/cAPz4pYPtQEXivqe11EcDE/-Preview--Minimal-Web.v6.0.0?node-id=0-10803&t=3LTmzx1gsei98asQ-1), [Components Library – Platforms Code Community](https://www.figma.com/design/RnpRa9ycRW9iBddZmlB8XZ/Components-Library---Platforms-Code--Community-?node-id=1-1183&t=9lO7s0CQlaNE3gvJ-1), and [Material UI](https://www.figma.com/design/ZaVM1rtN3BEnOx6bU6iVln/Material-UI-for-Figma--and-MUI-X---Community-?node-id=4213-2103&t=Av3TgoSA2qzZxy9V-1), create the following UI components in Figma using Variants:
    
    *   Buttons → Primary, Secondary, With Icon
    *   Input Fields → Text Input, Password Input, With Label, With Error State
*   For both Buttons and Input Fields, include the following states:
    
    *   Enabled
    *   Hovered
    *   Pressed
    *   Disabled
1.  Apply Components in Web Screens
*   Use the components you created to design 2 simple Web Screens:
    
    *   Login Page
    *   Sign Up Page
👉 Make sure you use the different button/input states properly in the screens where it makes sense.
✅ Deliverable:
*   A Figma file that includes:
    
    *   Button & Input Field components with all required states built as Variants.
    *   Login and Sign Up web screens built using these components.

Task Details:  
Create a form design in Figma that demonstrates all possible input field variations.
Form must include the following input types:
*   Text input (single line)
    
*   Textarea (multi-line input)
    
*   Email input
    
*   Password input (with show/hide toggle)

Requirements:
Use Auto Layout for all elements.
Each field should show different states:
*   Default (enabled)
    
*   Focused
    
*   Filled
    
*   Error
    
*   Disabled
    
Apply consistent spacing, labels, and helper/error texts.
Follow the style/structure of the design systems shared earlier (Material UI, Ant Design, etc.).
Deliverable:  
A Figma file containing one page with the complete form, showing all variations of input fields.
